- It is an evolutionary computation (or evolutionary algorithms or EAs) technique that automatically solves problems without requiring the user to know or specify the form or structure of the solution in advance.
- It is an systematic, domain-independent method for getting computers to solve problems automatically starting from a high-level statement.

1. fitness: how well a programm works
2. crossover: creataion of a child programm by chosen parts from two selected parent programm
3. mutation: creation of a child programm by randomly altering a randomly chosen part of a selectd parent programm
